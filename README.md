## Overview of the statistical analysis:

W. Avy is still a bit uncertain of his decision, so he wants to get more information about temperature trends before saying yes to the surf shop. 
We need to extract temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop 
business is sustainable year-round. We are looking to find if people will buy ice cream in those months. 


## Results:

First we will take a look at the results of the analysis temperature of June and December. 

**June Temperature Analysis Results**

**December Temperature Analysis Results**

From the info above we can realize about this three main differences: 
- We can observe that in December, the temperature is 8 degrees (¬∞F) lower than in June. 
- The sample of December is 8% smaller than the one for June. 
- At the mid percentil of the data, december temperature is 4 degrees lower than June. 

## Summary:

When you observe the data description for each month, you can realize there are no really strong differences between both months. So to more queries were important 
for me to go over: the june and the december precipitation, because this also can have an impact on people while deciding to buy an ice cream üç¶  despite the temperature.

Lets see the **June Precipitation statistics**:

Now a look at **December precipitation statiscs description**:

At the tables above its seen that the data is also pretty similar, so we can conclude both months will be similar in both temperatures and precipitations. Just the max precipitation value its occuring on december but the mean is mainly the same through both months.
